# Car Rental Management  

A system made for the admin that helps the admin to add, remove, and rent out cars according to their availability
The system effectively manages the admin panel from sign up to sign in and then the data entry as well. It allows the admin to enter the data about the cars and then store it in text files which are later used for finding and renting the cars to the customers according to availability of them.  
File handling is effectively used to store the data for long term use for the records to be kept maintained.
